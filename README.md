## Human Life Programming Language

>HLPL (abbreviation for Human Life Programming Language) is a new programming language developed for the creation of characters and their living environments electronically

>The simulation of nature (or the environment) refers to the construction of cities, villages and everything else that occurs in nature, such as trees, mountains, clouds, sky, earth ...etc. HLPL takes static data (images) from an environment (to be cloned) and then transforms this data into a dynamic view that changes at any position and time, just as it would in the real world if the views of things changed in position and time, which transforms these environments into e-cities

>Simulating characters refers to creating humans, animals, plants and everything in life as digital characters, including the interactions between different types of living beings and the emotions associated with them, even the inanimate ...etc. HLPL takes static data (images) of a character (to be cloned) and then turns that data into a dynamic view that changes at every angle, just as a character would behave in the real world if the photos taken changed depending on the camera direction; the second part is the cloning of the characterâ€™s mind, which is done by writing the character code (HLPL) based on the real life of the studied character; finally, the combination of appearance and mind in a single code results in an e-character that can be revived on the Internet through HLPL

>Characters created by HLPL can be revived by robotics, resulting in very human-like creatures; the larger the character code, the more the creation is human-like 

>Building a large character (a larger code that covers all the possibilities of a life to be simulated) leads to creating almost a simulation of life itself, in such a way that a normal character (human being) living with it cannot tell the difference or even recognize that it is robotics, this involves the use of simulations in skin, weight, movement styles and everything else. This requires high technology and a strong foundation.

>HLPL characters can be anything someone wants, they can be teachers, receptors for a business, and any kind of job that requires guiding and leadership. They can also hold physical jobs themselves, but that would require a lot of money to build such robots.

>HLPL characters can simulate a living entity as a character or a society as a group of characters interacting with each other in a given environment

>Each character is a zip file containing characters, animates, paths, places, codes, etc.

>Each city (or village) is a zip file with images of its surroundings such as buildings, houses, trees, mountains, paths and all sorts of things, depending on the location and viewing direction
